High level overview of replicating the functionality  in another language:-

The idea is to expose an interface from the current language in use to another, which is  following the DRY principle that says Dont Repeat Yourself.
Therefore if a functionality to recite a poem  in c# already exists,there's no need to re-write in another language,instead the functionality should be
extended to the new language,or made available to another language.And the best way to do that would be to expose the functionality via an API(Application programming interface),
This basically allows one to plug into an existing functionality written in a different language.Because the logic has been implemented and encapsulated in c#,
The same should not be done in another language,i would just tap into the API using the synthax of the new language to use the functionality already implemented.
In this case,the same data integrity would exist across all framework i.e the end result of the same function written in c# would exist if it were to be consumed
and utilized in java.

That is the way i would go by this process.

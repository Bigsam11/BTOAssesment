High level overview of replicating the program in another language

1.If this solution is to be replicated in an OOP accepted language,
first thing to do is to produce a synthax equivalent of Inheritance and polymorphism.

e.g,In Java,to inherit properties from another class,"extends" keyword is used.
but to inherit methods from an interface,the "implements" keyword is used.

2.After that has been settled,I would declare a base class,one which all our preceding  classes would be derived from.
E.g "Human" class in this instance happens to be our base class or template.

3.After creating a base class or template class,we  declare the properties that determines the types of animals that
will be instantiated and its respective constructors.
e.g name,sound,numberOfLegs,hasTail e.t.c

4.We declare an interface containing a method named after an action our different instances of animal
will be performing which will contains the actual method "recitePoem".

5.After the above (No_4) has been done,I would inherit the method "recitePoem" by
affixing the recquired synthax to denote inheritance from the interface.

6.I would create new instance of the template or base class which will reflect 
the new state of the base class,then simultaneously pass in the parameter into the class constructors.
since i will be inheriting from  interface(ICanrecitePoem) i could very well just express as:-

ICanrecitePoem dog = new Animal("Dog","bark");

the above steps lays alot of emphasis on polymorphism and inheritance.

Then the result is rendered on console.
